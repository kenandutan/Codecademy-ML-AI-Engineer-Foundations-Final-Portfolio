 Codecademy ML/AI Engineer Foundations: Final Portfolio Project

This Codecademy Portfolio Project is to display my proficiency in the fundamentals of ML/AI engineering to analyze a set of data.

This will consist of:

1. Scoping out the project
2. Selecting a data analysis problem
3. Collecting data or utilizing a dataset
4. Loading and checking the data
5. Cleaning the data and prepping it for exploratory data analysis
6. Summarizing the statistics, visualizing the data, and documenting the findings
7. Communicating the findings by making it easier to understand for the general public

The data analysis problem is: What are some things students can do to minimimize stressors in their lives?

The data I am using is: the "Student Stress Factors: A Comprehensive Analysis" dataset from Kaggle.
